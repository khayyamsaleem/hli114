* Background
- Great German epic

* Kriemhild
- The fairest maiden in all the land
- Caused pain to many knights because of her beauty
- Lives with mother and two brothers -- all of whom are worthy warriors 
- Has a dream (p. 18) about her falcon being taken by two eagles
- The dream will be a parallel for her struggles later on in the poem
- Marries Siegfried, and receives Brunhild's girdle from Siegfried 
- When visiting Brunhild, she reveals the girdle as proof that Gunther didn't deflower Brunhild

* Brunhild
- Doesn't want to marry Gunther 
- Gunther forces her hand by outperforming her in three contests with Siegfried's help 
- Brunhild is suspicious and refuses to give up her viriginity to Gunther after the wedding
- Siegfried helps Gunther again and she loses her virginity -- and her strength as a result
- After this even she continues to question how all this happened and wishes to see Siegfried again 
- Brunhild taunts Kriemhild, claiming that Siegfried is a mere vassal and therefore Kriemhild's marriage is shameful
- Kriemhild shows Brunhild the girdle to prove Gunther didn't deflower her alone (or at all)
- Brunhild grieves, and when Gunther learns why he doesn't dare to question Siegfried

* Siegfried
- Handsome prince, civilized, well-dressed, sociable, etc.
- Lives in a kingdom in the Netherlands
- Hears of Kriemhild and is promised joy and Siegfried desires her 
- Sieg's parent disapprove of this marriage since Kriemhild is out of the tribe
- Is allowed to seek Kriemhild so long as he heeds his father's warning

- Receives his mother's blessing and requests from her the finest /clothes/
- Slew a dragon and bathed in its blood, grew invincible with and unknown weakeness
- Achieves marriage with Kriemhild by aiding Gunther
- Lacks self-awareness -- helps Gunther needlessly and is always ready to go into conflict
- Takes Brunhild's ring and girdle when raping her with Gunther 
    - Remains unknown whether he had sex with Brunhild, but this action
    signifies the taking of virginity
- Angered by his wife's actions in speaking independently, and beats her for it

* Siegfried's Rape of Brunhild 
- Unknown whether he did it or not 
- He takes her girdle anyway -- which is a symbol of taking virginity

* Gunther 
- Cowardly king (in our eyes); "Machiavellian king"

    - This is the opposite of Siegfried, who goes into all battles with an intent of winning on his own
- Uses Siegfried to fight the Saxons and do all kinds of other tasks frequently
- Marries Brunhild but isn't strong enough to "own" her
- Does not take Brunhild's virginity, but with Siegfried's help he gains control over Brunhild
- Although he warns Siegfried to not take Brunhild's virginity, he does not hold him accountable for doing so

* Opening 
- "We are told in old stories  of many wonders 
    of praiseworthy heroes  of much toil 
    of joys and celebrations  of weeping and of wailing
    of bold warriors  of untold heroes?"
